# Genetic algorithm

- recombination operator
    - use the proposed improved one from A Comparison of Recombination Operators for Capacitate Vehicle Routing Problem

- fix the BRBAX steepest improvement


# Tabu Search

- fuck taburoute
    - the description is cryptic at best
    - relies on previous algorithms (not standalone at all (relies on GENI and US))
    - not simple at all


# Taillard
- pretty readable
- seems very efficient
- problem: uses an other exact solver (ref[20])
    - The symmetric traveling salesman problem and edge exchanges in minimal 1-tree


# Construction heuristics

- clark & wright savings
    - not a tabu search
